1. Sum all elements in a list is in the file Suminlist.py
I was able to tacke this using 2 for loops

2. Check if a number is even or odd is in the file oddoreven.py
I was able to do this using the modulus operation and an if statement

3. Compute factorial using a loop is in the file factorial_loop.py
I was able to tackle this by adding another variable and adding a for loop

4. Reverse a string (without using [::-1] or built-in methods) is in the file Reverse_string.py
It was simple to do due to the use of the while loop

5. Factorial (Recursive) is in the file Factorial_recursive.py
I was able to declare the base case and the recursive case and once that was done it was simple to create the recursive function

6. Sum of Digits of a Number is in the file sumofdigits.py
The use of modulus is what was able to make this task possible.
